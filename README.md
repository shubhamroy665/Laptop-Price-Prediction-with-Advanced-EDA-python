# Laptop Price Prediction with Advanced EDA

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on predicting laptop prices using various machine learning models and advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The project demonstrates the use of regression algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to build and evaluate predictive models for laptop pricing.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the dataset used for the project.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and model building.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features of laptops, such as:

- Brand
- RAM Size
- Storage Size
- Processor Speed
- Screen Size
- and more...

The dataset is available in the `data/` directory.
